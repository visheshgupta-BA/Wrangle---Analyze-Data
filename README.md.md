# |Data Wrangling|
# Analysis of Annaul Growth rate and death rate of Countries.

In this study we are going to look at the data which consists of crude death rate (deaths per 1000 population) of the countries and the annaul growth of the country. We will look at visual representation and see how the relationship can be seen in between these two. We also look at these graphs individually to understand the patterns and give insights.
</br>
We are going to compare how the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, China, India, South Africa) nations stand along with United States and United Kingdon. We will analyze each chart one by one. All the data and charts are taken from https://www.worlddev.xyz/ </br> </br>

## Annaul Growth for 2018

### As depicted in this chart, we can clearly see that India and Russia had exellent growth rate at about 6% followed by China, USA and UK. Brazil had the lowest growth rate.</br></br>

## Annaul Growth for 2020

### In this chart we can see that covid happened in 2020 and most countries enforced lockdowns, due to which the gdp growth is negative for all the countries. India was hit the worst with more that -7% growth and China was least affected.</br></br>

## Annaul Growth for 2020 (with Pie Chart)

### Here is same data but with Pie chart representation, Pie chart really helps when we want to see individual contributions of limited entities. As we can see here that when all the gdp growth combined, India and Russia constitutes more than half the growth amongst these countries. </br></br>

## Annaul Growth for 1969 - 2020

### Soviet Union fall explains the Russian GDP growth starting in 1993, most of the countries fell in 2020 due to covid as we saw earlier. There is one more thing to note here, the United Kingdom and United States are developed nations so their gdp growth has stabalized, where as the developiong countries growth is very high. Which also means that even though their growth is lower compared to developing countries but their total gdp is way higher than these. </br></br>

## Annaul Growth for 2005 - 2020

### This is the same chart but with more details for recent years. Russia's gdp growth looks very volatile as a lot of fluctuations can be seen, we can also see that almost all countries went down in 2008 when the american economy collapsed, which tells how different countries economy is impacted when there is a recession in one of the major economies. </br></br>

## Death Rate 2018
![](https://github.com/amishraUMBC/data690_world_dev/blob/main/charts/Bar%20Chart%20Death%202018.png)</br>
### This is death rate chart of the following countries. The death rate is based on deaths per 1000 population. Russia has highest death rate for 2018 and Brazil is at the bottom. One thing to notice here is that if we consider the population of these countries we can see a different story, for example even though India and China has less deaths per 1000 people but due to their hugh population, even a small percentage accounts for a lot more people. Russia has a small population of about 140 million but still the death rate is alarming. </br></br>

## Death Rate for 1960 - 2020
![](https://github.com/amishraUMBC/data690_world_dev/blob/main/charts/Line%20Chart%20death%20rate%201963-2020.png)</br>
### We can see that India, China and Brazil have drastically improved since last 60 years. We will have to do some research why South Africa's death rate went high at around 2005-2006 (here is paper on that: https://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P03093/P030932005.pdf). We can see Russia, US and UK death rate going up in 2020 because of covid deaths. The reason other countries death rate is still low could be that covid hit them late or it could be that the cases were not being reported correctly or being under reported in these developing nations. Same could be said for the death rate itself as there might a lot of deaths which goes unreported. </br></br>

## Relationship between Deaths and GDP Growth
![](https://github.com/amishraUMBC/data690_world_dev/blob/main/charts/Scatter%20Plot%202019.png)</br>
### This is scatter plot for all the countries showing the relationship between the death rate and the annual growth rate of the countries. As we saw earlier, India and China has somewhat average death rate but the number of deaths are very high when compared to other countries. Bulgaaboria has the highest death rate with an average gdp growth of about 6%, Qatar has the lowest death rate with a negative gdp of growth of -2.6%. Ethiopia had the highest annual growth rate for 2019 with less death rate than the majority of the nations. One thing that we saw earlier is that when the deaths went up in 2020 due to covid, all the countries went in negative in terms of the gdp growth. Similarly for russia, the death rate went up around 2000 - 2004 and at the time there was a decrease in the gdp growth.</br></br> 

## Scatter plot Relationship between Deaths and GDP Growth including USA.
![](https://github.com/amishraUMBC/data690_world_dev/blob/main/charts/Scatter%20Plot%20Brics%202019.png)</br>
### Here is the scatter plot for 2019 depicting the relationship between the gdp and deaths. India and China are on the top in terms of annual growth with the crude death rate of around 7. USA has a lower growth rate with a higher death rate of about 8.8. Russia has a very high death rate of more than 12 and gpd growth in negative which again explains the trend which we discussed int he previous section. Brazil has the lowest death rate amongst these countries.</br></br>
